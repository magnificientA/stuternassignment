        </h2>
        <p id="reason">
            Being a web developer has being my dream for a very long time, <br>
            it all began when my dad bought an android phone for me in jss1 <br>
            it was fun being around phone, since then i used my phone for so <br>
            many experiments i went ahead tapping into my dad hotspot just <br>to watch 
            tutorials on youtube. Then finally i was well known both home <br>and school
            for being versatile with phones and computer, if anyone had <br> issue(software issue) 
            they do call me to help them out. So during  my Jss3 summer holiday I went for <br>
            a wordpress design training which our tutor was a very young Lad so ever seens then i <br>
             have being pursuing my career in tech.
